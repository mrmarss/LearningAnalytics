# LearningAnalytics
"Disruptive innovation is already at work in higher education, and universities have to look no further than online classes to see examples of change at scale" said Clay Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor. One of the key components of online classes is the Assessment. All of the major learning management systems have some sort of online assessment component and analytics built on top of it. There is not much progress made on analytics for programming assignments. These online platforms are collecting lot of data about how a learner is solving programming assignments, but there is not much feedback provided neither to the learner nor to the instructor based on that data. So focus of this project is to analyze programming assignment data per problem and highlight useful patterns with some visualization both for instructors and learners.
